      <h2>Projects I’m proud to talk about</h2>
      <p class="muted" style="max-width: 640px; margin-top: 4px;">
        Due to NDAs, some projects only show up in high-level form. If you’d like
        specifics, I’m happy to walk you through them on a call.
      </p>

      <div style="margin-top: 18px; display: grid; gap: 20px;">
        <!-- Case Study 1 -->
        <article class="card">
          <div class="card-header-line">Case study · Pedal EV chassis</div>
          <h3>Building a pedal EV chassis supply chain from India to Germany</h3>
          <p>
            In 2022, I partnered with a German start-up to industrialise and export
            a complete pedal EV chassis from India. They had a design and a vision –
            we built the supply chain.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Converted 3D concepts into 2D manufacturing drawings and documentation</li>
            <li>Sourced and onboarded vendors for casting, machining, and sheet metal</li>
            <li>Set up central assembly and shipped CKD kits to Germany</li>
            <li>Coordinated production, quality and export logistics end-to-end</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted" style="margin-top: 8px;">
            Result: Export-ready chassis assemblies with a repeatable, scalable
            supply chain from India to Germany.

        <!-- Case Study 2 -->
        <article class="card">
          <div class="card-header-line">Case study · Precision components</div>
          <h3>Scaling precision components for a global drive manufacturer</h3>
          <p>
            For a leading drive manufacturer with multiple plants in India, I helped
            standardise the supply of closing caps and spacer tubes across facilities.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Managed production of 30+ variants of closing caps and spacer tubes</li>
            <li>Supplied multiple plants from a single, aligned vendor ecosystem</li>
            <li>Stabilised quality, documentation and delivery performance</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted" style="margin-top: 8px;">
            Result: A stable, multi-plant supply chain with consistent quality and
            on-time deliveries over 1.5–2 years.

        <!-- Case Study 3 -->
        <article class="card">
          <div class="card-header-line">Case study · Instrumentation castings</div>
          <h3>Improving cost &amp; quality for high-value casting orders</h3>
          <p>
            For a key instrumentation client, I worked on casting projects with strict
            tolerance and reliability requirements.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Broke down part cost into material, machining, overheads &amp; tooling</li>
            <li>Worked with vendors to reduce rework and scrap</li>
            <li>Protected margins while keeping the client cost-competitive</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted" style="margin-top: 8px;">
            Result: Better profitability without compromising precision or export timelines.
